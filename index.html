          <p class="para">
            You also need to take into consideration where the house is actually located. In this instance, there are a few things you should keep in mind as you conduct your search. If the house you
            want to buy is right on a busy road or very near to a highway, you can probably get it for a lower price, but it will also be more difficult to sell later on. The same may hold true for
            houses that stand next to or back onto commercial property, such as a grocery store or gas station, or houses on streets that get an unusual amount of parking traffic and parked cars, such
            as those near large churches or community centers

          <h2>1. Apply</h2>
          <p class="para">
            If you have found a property you would like to rent, the next step is to complete an application form. The application form is your way of showing the landlord and agent that you are the
            best candidate for the property, that you are able to pay the rent and that you will look after the property as specified in the tenancy agreement. Your application is reviewed against all
            the other applicants so making sure yours stands out is important.

            Our staff will contact you on the property choosen on futher enquires,Rental history is information on your past rental arrangements, which includes former addresses, late rent payments
            and evictions, as well as criminal history, your credit score and other data to help a landlord judge whether or not you're a good fit as a tenant. This information is to renting what your
            credit score is to getting a finance for a loan. If you have a good rental report you are more likely to be approved for a rental than if you have a poor rental history report.
